We then use the ProtodashExplainer to obtain spam and ham prototypes based on the labels assigned by the text classifier. \n",

    "In order to run this notebook, please: \n",
    "1. Download [UCI SMS dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection) dataset and place the directory 'smsspamcollection' in the location of this notebook. \n",

    "3. Create 2 folders: \"results\" and \"logs\" in the location of this notebook (these are used to store training logs). \n",
